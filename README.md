A portfolio website is an online platform where individuals, often creative professionals like designers, developers, photographers, writers, or artists, showcase their work, skills, and experience. It typically includes a collection of past projects, a brief about the person or their services, contact information, and sometimes a blog or testimonials. Portfolio websites serve as a personal brand hub, making it easier for potential clients or employers to view a person's work and get in touch. It's an essential tool for demonstrating expertise and building a professional online presence.
